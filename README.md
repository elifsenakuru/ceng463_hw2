# CENG 463 - NLP Assignment 2

This repository contains the implementation for CENG 463 - Introduction to NLP Assignment 2. The objective of this assignment is to identify political ideology and orientation in parliamentary debates using multilingual language models.

Project Overview
In this assignment, we focus on analyzing parliamentary debates in different languages and classifying the political orientation (left or right) of the speakers. The task involves leveraging pretrained language models for multilingual text classification.

Tasks
Task 1: Identify the political orientation of speakers in Turkish parliamentary debates.
Task 2: Extend the analysis to French parliamentary debates by applying the same approach with language-specific changes.
Models Used
XLM-Roberta: A multilingual transformer model trained on over 100 languages.
LLaMA: A causal language model used for zero-shot inference in both Turkish and French datasets.
